This directory is for project-specific (private) libraries.

PlatformIO will compile these libraries and include them in the build process.

Place any custom libraries here that are not available in the PlatformIO Registry.

The source code of each library should be placed in separate directories:

lib/
|--MyCustomLibrary/
|  |--src/
|     |--MyCustomLibrary.h
|     |--MyCustomLibrary.cpp
