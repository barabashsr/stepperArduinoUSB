This directory is for data files that may be uploaded to the device file system.

For devices with SPIFFS, LittleFS, or SD card support, files placed here can be uploaded using:

pio run -t uploadfs

Potential uses:
- Configuration files
- Web interface files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Calibration data
- G-code or command sequences

Note: The Arduino Mega does not have built-in filesystem support, but this directory is included for future expansion (e.g., SD card support).
