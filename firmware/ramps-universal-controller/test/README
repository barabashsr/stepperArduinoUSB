This directory is for PlatformIO Unit Testing and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method where individual units of source code are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

Example test structure:

test/
|--test_main.cpp
|--test_device/
|  |--test_stepper.cpp
|  |--test_servo.cpp
|--test_command/
   |--test_parser.cpp

To run tests:
pio test
